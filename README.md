# DIGITAL-CLOCK
This project is a simple yet elegant digital clock built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays the current time in a 24-hour format along with the full date and day of the week. The clock updates every second in real time, making it a perfect example for beginners learning DOM manipulation and styling with CSS Flexbox.
